    "answers": [
      "Our referral program is designed to significantly reward you for bringing new users to Youmint. For each successful referral:",
      "• Fixed Bonus: You earn a fixed bonus of 3 million YUM tokens.",
      "• Multiplier Bonus: You also earn an additional 20% of \"your own\" base (tier-based) registration allocation as a bonus. This multiplier helps you grow your total YUM holdings faster based on your initial tier. This multiplier bonus has a cap (e.g., it can increase your total earnings from referrals up to 5 times your base allocation, typically achieved after around 25 referrals).",
      "Here's how to participate:",
      "1. Once you pre-register, you'll receive a unique referral link and code on your Profile page.",
      "2. Share your referral link with friends through social media, messaging apps, or email. The referral message on your profile page is a great template to use!",
      "3. When someone registers using your referral link (or manually enters your code), they're counted as your successful referral.",
      "4. There's no limit to how many people you can refer.",
      "5. All rewards are tracked in your profile and will be part of your total allocation distributed at launch.",
      "Pro Tip: The more friends you refer, the larger your YUM token allocation becomes due to both the fixed bonus and the powerful multiplier effect on your base tier allocation!"
    ]
  },
  {
    "question": "How many YUM tokens will I receive?",
    "answers": [
      "Your total YUM token allocation from the airdrop is determined by two main components:",
      "1. Tier-Based Registration Allocation:",
      "When you pre-register, you lock in a base allocation of YUM tokens. This amount is tier-based, meaning the allocation per user decreases with each subsequent tier as more users join. Early registrants secure a higher base allocation.",
      "For example, Tier 1 offers 100 million YUM, Tier 2 offers 75 million YUM, and so on. The exact amounts for each tier are displayed on the home page.",
      "2. Referral Rewards:",
      "For each person you successfully refer, you earn: • A fixed 3 million YUM tokens. • An additional bonus equal to 20% of your tier-based registration allocation. This multiplier significantly boosts your rewards based on your early registration tier. This multiplier has a cap (e.g. up to 5x your base after ~25 referrals).",
      "Example: If your tier-based registration allocation is 100 million YUM (Tier 1), and you refer 1 friend: • Fixed bonus: 3 million YUM • Multiplier bonus: 20% of 100 million YUM = 20 million YUM • Total from this referral: 23 million YUM",
      "If you refer 10 people, you would earn (10 x 3 million) + (10 x 20 million) = 230 million YUM tokens from referrals, plus your initial 100 million base allocation, totaling 330 million YUM (assuming you haven't hit the multiplier cap).",
      "Your total allocation is the sum of your tier-based registration allocation and all your earned referral rewards. You can track your current estimated allocation and referral count in your Profile and Analytics pages. The total airdrop pool is 25 Trillion YUM tokens."

    "question": "Do referrals have to use my link to count?",

      "• They manually enter your referral code on the registration page",
      "• They enter your referral code on the home page when prompted",
      "For best results, we recommend sharing your full referral link rather than just the code. The link automatically applies your referral code when clicked. The promotional message on your profile page is designed for easy sharing.",
